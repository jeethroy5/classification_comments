However, I was wondering if there is a connection between it and the standard way to graph each equation and see their intersection as the solution set. I graphed a couple of x22 systems by hand the standard way, with your initial and final vectors superimposed. Obviously the initial vector points to the coordinates of the solution in( the case of a single point solution). If there is no other correspondence, my best explanation would be that, graphed the standard way, the lines are already using the same information that you interpret as a linear transformation. So trying to see how your matrix transforms the graph of the lines is a little bit like trying to apply the same transformation twice. Is that about right? Should I just compartmentalize these two visualizations?",145,100.0
