When we fill nan value with median for train dataset features we can use that median value to fill nan in test also so that we are using train to transform in test. . I think that it right because when we deployed our model on production then we do not have test data to calculate median so we can use train dataset features median value in that case. There are lots of things like this. Am I correct?. If wrong then correct me please. üôèüôèüôè,110,98.18181818
