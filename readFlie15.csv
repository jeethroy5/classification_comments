THIS SET DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF BECAUSE IT IS NOT A CAT. A SET IS NOT A CAT AND A CAT IS NOT A SET. THIS IS BOOLEAN LOGIC. THIS IS BINARY LOGIC. THE STATEMENT IS EITHER TRUE OR FALSE. A STATEMENT CANNOT BE BOTH TRUE AND FALSE. THE TWOS COMPLEMENT OF A BOOLEAN STATEMENT IS ITS EXACT OPPOSITE. IF THE STATEMENT IS TRUE, THEN ITS COMPLEMENT IS FALSE. IF THE STATEMENT IS FALSE THEN ITS COMPLEMENT IS TRUE. THE SET OF ALL CATS DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF BECAUSE THE SET IS NOT ITSELF A CAT. THE TWOS COMPLEMENT OF THIS STATEMENT IS: THE SET OF ALL THINGS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN CATS DOES CONTAIN ITSELF BECAUSE IT IS A SET AND BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY CATS. ANY SET THAT CONTAINS REAL TANGIBLE THINGS THAT CAN BE SEEN, HEARD, SMELLED, TASTED AND TOUCHED. WILL NOT CONTAIN ITSELF BECAUSE A SET IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS REAL AND TANGIBLE; WHICH CAN BE SEEN, HEARD, SMELLED, TASTED AND TOUCHED. SUCH A SET THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF WILL HAVE A COMPLEMENT THAT DOES CONTAIN ITSELF. IF A SET CONTAINS REAL THINGS, THEN IT WILL NOT CONTAIN ITSELF. THE COMPLEMENT OF THIS SET IS A SET WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN REAL THINGS AND IT WILL CONTAIN ITSELF. THIS TYPE OF TRUE OR FALSE, MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BINARY LOGIC IS THE BASIS FOR ALL MATHEMATICS. BERTRAND RUSE LS ' PARADOX IS NOT MATHEMATICAL IN NATURE. THE PARADOX ITSELF IS A WORD SALAD WHICH BYPASSES BOOLEAN LOGIC AND THUS CONFUSES MOST PEOPLE WITH SEMANTICS. RUSSELL ASKED THE QUESTION: "" THE' SET OF ALL SETS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF' DOES THIS SET CONTAIN ITSELF? "" THIS LEADS TO A CIRCULAR ARGUMENT. THE CIRCULAR ARGUMENT GOES LIKE THIS: IF THE SET DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF, THEN IT IS ONE OF THE SETS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS WITHIN THE SET OF ALL THINGS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF AND THEREFORE THE SET DOES CONTAIN ITSELF. THIS IS A CONTRADICTION! CONVERSELY, IF THIS SET OF ALL THINGS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF, DOES CONTAIN ITSELF, THEN IT IS NOT A SET THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF, WHICH INFERS THAT A SET OF ALL THINGS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF CANNOT LOGICALLY EXIST BECAUSE IT WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE TO CONTAIN ITSELF. ANOTHER CONTRADICTION. THE PARADOX IS BASED ON THE PRESUMPTION THAT SUCH A SET WILL EITHER CONTAIN ITSELF AND NOT CONTAIN ITSELF AT THE SAME TIME, OR IT WILL NOT CONTAIN ITSELF AND NOT NOT CONTAIN ITSELF AT THE SAME TIME. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? WORD' SALAD!' RUSE LS ' PARADOX IS THE MOST FAMOUS OF ALL PARADOXES BECAUSE IT SEEMS COMPLETELY UN RESOLVABLE. THE PARADOX APPARENTLY HAS NO SOLUTION! BUT THIS IS BECAUSE THE WAY THE QUESTION IS WORDED FOCUSES ON THE SEMANTICS AND NOT ON THE BINARY LOGIC OF TWOS COMPLEMENTS. RUSSEL ASKED THE QUESTION: "" THE' SET OF ALL SETS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF' DOES THIS SET CONTAIN ITSELF? "" THE ANSWER IS A SIMPLE NO, IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF. WHY? BECAUSE THE COMPLEMENT OF A SET OF ALL SETS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF, IS THE SET OF ALL SETS THAT DOES CONTAIN ITSELF. THIS SET OF ALL SETS THAT DOES CONTAIN ITSELF WILL CONTAIN ITSELF. ITS COMPLEMENT IS THE SET OF ALL THINGS THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN ITSELF AND THIS SET WILL NOT CONTAIN ITSELF. THIS IS COMPLETELY VALID LOGICALLY. THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION HERE! FOCUS ON THE BINARY LOGIC AND THE WHOLE THING CLEARS UP INSTANTLY. BUT FOCUS ON THE SEMANTICS . YOU GET THE ABOVE WORD SALAD . AND RUSE LS ' PARADOX WILL FOREVER BE UNSOLVABLE!",614,99.51140065
